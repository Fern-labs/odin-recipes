    <a href="./pizza.html">The Real Chicago Deep-Dish Pizza Dough</a>
    <p>
      I have it on good authority that this is the real deep-dish pizza dough
      that's used in Chicago. The real thing is nothing like bread or even pizza
      dough. It's a buttery, flaky crust that's achieved by using corn oil (not
      butter) and minimal mixing and kneading times. The pizza itself is built
      with cheese, toppings, and sauce, in that order. Contrary to popular
      opinion, Chicago pizzerias do not use cornmeal in the dough.
