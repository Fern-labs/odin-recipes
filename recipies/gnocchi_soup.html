    <p>
      This creamy chicken gnocchi soup is a favorite for cool weather sports
      nights when we all eat at different times. After adding the chicken and
      gnocchi, throw it in a slow cooker on the lowest setting so it is ready
      when you are. Serve with pesto bread sticks.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 large zucchini, diced</li>
      <li>2 stalks celery, diced</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
      <li>½ red bell pepper, diced</li>
      <li>2 carrots, shredded</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3 cups chicken broth, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
      <li>1 pint fat-free half-and-half</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken meat</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package small gnocchi</li>
      <li>2 cups torn fresh spinach</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground thyme</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt butter with olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Cook
        and stir zucchini, celery, onion, red bell pepper, carrots, and garlic
        in hot butter-oil until vegetables are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in
        flour until vegetables are coated; cook for 2 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in chicken broth and stir until flour paste combines with broth and
        soup is thick and smooth, about 5 minutes. Pour in both kinds of
        half-and-half; bring to a simmer. Cook until soup is slightly thickened,
        about 5 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently fold chicken, gnocchi, and spinach into soup. Season with thyme,
        nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Adjust thickness by adding more chicken broth,
        if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
